# Automation-Account-Terraform

The intention of this POC is to show case the fact we can provision
1) automation account
2) runbooks

 This also showcases importing of
 1) Publicly hosted modules
 2) Private/Custom modules

 Sample Usage Instructions

 1) Login to your az cli
 2) create a sample var.tfvars file with relevant params
 3) checkout the repo locally
 4) execute terraform init,plan,apply commands sequentially

PS: Please bear in mind this script is geared towards ubunutu OS, in case you want to run from Windows, you can leverage on the
WSL 2 feature and run the script from there.

 Watch the magic happen :)
